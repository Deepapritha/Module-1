## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking Vowel or not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to read a number and check whether the number is divisible by both 9 and 5 or not using  if else statement.
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take a integer input from the user
3. Check if the number is divisible by both 9 and 5
4. If it is divisible, print "Number is divisible by both 9 and 5".
5. Otherwise, display "Number is not divisible by both 5 and 9"
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```
n=int(input())
if n%9==0 and n%5==0:
    print(f"{n} is divisible by both 5 and 9")
else:
    print(f"{n} is NOT divisible by both 5 and 9")
```
