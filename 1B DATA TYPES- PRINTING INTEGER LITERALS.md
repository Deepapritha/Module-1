# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the following integer literals: 123, 456, 789.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Initialize the integer literals `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the numbers `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```
a = 123
b = 456
c = 789
print("123 456 789")

```

## RESULT
Thus the Python program for printing the following integer literals: 123, 456, 789 is successfully done and verified.
